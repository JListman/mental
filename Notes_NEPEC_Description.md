In April 2016, VA's Northeast Program Evaluation Center (NEPEC) released mental health statistics for fiscal year 2015 - the annual datasheet. This dataset consists of VA Medical Center level statistics on the prevalence, mental health utilization, non-mental health utilization, mental health workload, and psychological testing of Veterans with a possible or confirmed diagnosis of mental illness. This application is designed to help explore these mental health measures. Get started by picking a category and then a measure to see the distribution and ranking of medical centers.
